               <h3 class="argument-heading">Improves Emotional Regulation & Coping</h3>
               <p>Horror is better because it lets viewers put themselves in a scary situation where they experience intense emotions in a controlled environment. An article by Marnie Vinall explains how the genre can be helpful: “Watching horror films can also be an opportunity to confront one’s fears as the viewer withstands the horror and gets to enjoy the payoff of resolution” (Vinall, 2020). Another article by Scott McGreal goes over how recent studies show that people who watch horror movies often experience less psychological distress and have better coping skills (McGreal, 2020). Comedy, on the other hand, provides a temporary escape from negative emotions rather than a safe space to practice managing them.</p>

               <h3 class="argument-heading">Reveals Society Fears</h3>
               <p>Secondly, horror is better at showcasing what society fears at a given time. In an article by V Renée (2016) for No Film School, she explains this as "its not the monsters themselves, but what they represent.” For example, the article mentions that while zombie movies had been around for a long time, "...it wasn't until the late 60s... when filmmakers like George A. Romero began to use the 'zombie' as a metaphor for societal problems, like consumerism.” (Renée, 2016). Comedy movies often use jokes to give relief, never confronting the fears but simply making fun of them.</p>

               <h3 class="argument-heading">Asking Yourself, “What Would I Do?”</h3>
               <p>Finally, horror can help people figure out their morals when the stakes are high, as many will ask themselves, "What would I do?" This is an area comedy doesn't have. For example, films like Saw or Insidious push characters to extremes. These films make viewers question whether they would try to save themselves, sacrifice someone else, or if they would escape successfully. Comedy makes jokes at a character's bad choices, but horror often forces us to worry about what we would do in those situations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Overall, while comedy provides an escape, horror dives deeper by building resilience, revealing fears of society, and questioning morals.</p>
