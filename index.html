               <h3 class="argument-heading">Broader Audience Appeal / Brings People Together </h3>
               <p>Comedy has universal appeal and brings people together in ways horror often can’t. Its countless sub-genres—like slapstick, satire, romantic comedy, and dark comedy—mean there’s something for everyone, regardless of age, taste, or culture. Unlike horror, which often caters to niche or mature audiences and is frequently rated R, comedy ranges from G to R, making it far more accessible. More importantly, comedy is social. It thrives in shared settings—watching a movie with family, laughing at a meme with friends, or enjoying a stand-up show together. Laughter isn’t just entertainment; it’s a bonding experience, backed by science, that creates stronger connections and lasting memories.</p>


               <h3 class="argument-heading">Health Benefits / Longevity & Cultural Impact</h3>
               <p>Comedy isn’t just good for a laugh—it’s good for you, and it’s been shaping culture for centuries. Scientifically, laughter reduces stress, boosts your immune system, improves heart health, and can even burn calories—up to 40 in just 15 minutes. While horror might spike adrenaline, comedy actually supports long-term well-being without the fear factor. Beyond health, comedy has proven cultural staying power. From ancient Greek plays to Shakespeare-inspired rom-coms like 10 Things I Hate About You, and from Chaplin’s silent films to today’s viral memes and late-night satire, comedy continues to evolve while holding a mirror to society. Comedians don’t just entertain—they challenge norms, spark conversation, and influence change, all while making us laugh.</p>


               <h3 class="argument-heading">Less Psychological Toll & More Everyday Relevance</h3>
               <p>Comedy fits into everyday life and leaves a positive mark—unlike horror, which can be emotionally taxing and less relatable. Horror often relies on fear, violence, and trauma, which can leave viewers anxious, disturbed, or even sleepless—especially younger or more sensitive audiences. Comedy, by contrast, uplifts. It helps people relax, unwind, and walk away feeling better, not worse. And it’s not just for movie nights—comedy shows up in our daily lives through memes, office jokes, TV shows, and social media. It’s a coping mechanism, a stress reliever, and a constant source of lightness in an often stressful world. Horror may be thrilling, but comedy is essential.</p>

               <h3 class="argument-heading">Improves Emotional Regulation & Coping</h3>
               <p>Horror is better because it lets viewers put themselves in a scary situation where they experience intense emotions in a controlled environment. An article by Marnie Vinall explains how the genre can be helpful: “Watching horror films can also be an opportunity to confront one’s fears as the viewer withstands the horror and gets to enjoy the payoff of resolution” (Vinall, 2020). Another article by Scott McGreal goes over how recent studies show that people who watch horror movies often experience less psychological distress and have better coping skills (McGreal, 2020). Comedy, on the other hand, provides a temporary escape from negative emotions rather than a safe space to practice managing them.</p>

               <h3 class="argument-heading">Reveals Society Fears</h3>
               <p>Secondly, horror is better at showcasing what society fears at a given time. In an article by V Renée (2016) for No Film School, she explains this as "its not the monsters themselves, but what they represent.” For example, the article mentions that while zombie movies had been around for a long time, "...it wasn't until the late 60s... when filmmakers like George A. Romero began to use the 'zombie' as a metaphor for societal problems, like consumerism.” (Renée, 2016). Comedy movies often use jokes to give relief, never confronting the fears but simply making fun of them.</p>

               <h3 class="argument-heading">Asking Yourself, “What Would I Do?”</h3>
               <p>Finally, horror can help people figure out their morals when the stakes are high, as many will ask themselves, "What would I do?" This is an area comedy doesn't have. For example, films like Saw or Insidious push characters to extremes. These films make viewers question whether they would try to save themselves, sacrifice someone else, or if they would escape successfully. Comedy makes jokes at a character's bad choices, but horror often forces us to worry about what we would do in those situations.</p>
                <br>
                <p>Overall, while comedy provides an escape, horror dives deeper by building resilience, revealing fears of society, and questioning morals.</p>
